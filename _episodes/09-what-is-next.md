## Open new doors with a programming language

Like version control, learning a programming language has a learning curve.  But the benefits after you learn it will be substantial.  It will open up a lot of doors for your current research, and you will have a valuable skill that is in demand in many fields including research.

> ## Python Example
> An example python notebook that is fully reproducible that does the exact same thing we just did manually to create that plot.

> [BATS niskin subset example](https://gist.github.com/adyork/2bc800067156b54fab855c389bd1a163#file-bats_niskin_subset_example-ipynb)
